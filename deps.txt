For Gruvbox Theme:
From AUR: gruvbox-material-icon-theme
From AUR: gruvbox-material-gtk-theme-git

Breeze snow cursor enable:
visit arch wiki cursors: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cursor_themes
Change cursor theme in /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme to xcursor-breeze-snow if you want the white breeze cursor like I do.
Use lxappearance to change the gtk theme to the gruvbox one, and change the icon theme to the gruvbox one, both are mentioned above.
Use qt5ct to change qt5 theme, (haven't found a gruvbox theme for qt yet, maybe will install kvantum and find a gruvbox theme for that.)

Make sure to read the .zshrc for a 'guide' on the oh-my-zsh plugins to install:
https://gist.github.com/dogrocker/1efb8fd9427779c827058f873b94df95 (zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting)
Make sure sure the required deps are installed and also install the zsh-exa-aliases plugin for better ls.

Also, for random art when launching the terminal (read .zshrc) install dt's colour scripts:

paru -S shell-color-scripts
yay -S shell-color-scripts
