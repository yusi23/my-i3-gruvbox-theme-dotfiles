# my-i3-gruvbox-theme-dotfiles
Make sure to prefix . on i3 and config folders:
So they look like:

.i3
.config

Folders like /etc/i3status.conf are self-explanatory about where they should reside on the system, just copy them to your system, for example copy i3status.conf to /etc like how it is here.

Couldn't upload my oh-my-zsh config since it is more than 100 files, but all it is, is just this gruvbox theme (https://github.com/sbugzu/gruvbox-zsh)
Make sure to install oh-my-zsh and if you want, change the theme to the one mentioned above ^.

All config files have been changed by me to match the gruvbox theme, I used this template (https://gist.github.com/thepont/3f71150cec091bae5ef304e28e3d9097) to change the colour codes, I also used colours from the official gruvbox theme too (https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

To have most of the deps etc.. installed, install the Manjaro I3 variant which comes with very good defaults (what I'm using), and it also comes with i3-gaps etc.. installed aswell. But still you will need to install some more deps (read deps.txt).

Make sure to read deps.txt and instructions.txt
