# my-i3-gruvbox-theme-dotfiles
Make sure to prefix . on i3 and config folders:
So they look like:

.i3
.config

Couldn't upload my oh-my-zsh config since it is more than 100 files, but all it is, is just this gruvbox theme (https://github.com/sbugzu/gruvbox-zsh)
Make sure to install oh-my-zsh and if you want, change the theme to the one mentioned above.
