Directory structure is mostly masked, make sure to prefix . on the folders that need them (readme.md)

for example /etc would be /etc on real hardware (root folder)

or .i3 would be in the home folder, same with .config

Also make sure to set the $TERMINAL variable to alacritty, as an environment variable (if you want)
See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Environment_variables 
for help on environment variables
